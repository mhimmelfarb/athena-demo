  "conclusion": {
    "summary": "NowSecure built a technical masterpiece but commercialized it like amateurs. The moat is real, the customer logos are nuclear, but the pricing model is customer-hostile, the value articulation is confused, and the go-to-market lacks discipline. This is a $100M asset trapped in a $20M business model.",
    "opportunity": "Fix the commercial model and unlock $15-20M ARR immediately. Commission PE firm or bring in commercial COO to inject pricing discipline, transparent packaging, and scalable sales process. The product works, the market needs it, the customers love it - you're just leaving 50% of revenue on the table through self-inflicted commercial wounds.",
    "urgency": "HIGH - Capital markets are unforgiving. Debt financing in 2022 suggests equity window closed. Either fix metrics and raise growth round OR prepare for strategic sale. Sitting still = valuation erosion.",
    "recommendation": "Immediate actions: (1) Publish transparent pricing (30 days), (2) Commission ROI study (45 days), (3) Own MARM category (60 days). Strategic decision: (90 days) Choose upmarket platform play OR prepare for strategic exit. Don't get stuck in middle market death valley."

## Zone Legend

| Zone | Description | Tool Landscape |
|------|-------------|----------------|
| **🟢 REMIDI TERRITORY** | Commercial strategy & enablement - underserved, no systematic tooling | White space |
| **🟡 SHARED ZONE** | Strategy informs, execution tools measure | Partial overlap |
| **⚪ ADJACENT** | Execution-heavy, well-tooled | Crowded (Salesforce, Gong, Gainsight, etc.) |
| **🔄 FEEDBACK LOOPS** | Intelligence that should flow back to strategy | Broken in most orgs |

---

## PHASE 1: COMMERCIAL STRATEGY FOUNDATION
### 🟢 REMIDI TERRITORY

| Step | Activity | Owner | Success Signals | Failure Indicators |
|------|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| 1.1 | **Market & Segment Selection** | CEO / Product / Marketing | Clear target segments with quantified TAM; resource allocation aligned to opportunity size | "We sell to everyone"; scattered wins across unrelated segments |
| 1.2 | **ICP Definition** | Marketing / Sales Leadership | Documented ICP with firmographic + behavioral criteria; sales can articulate in 30 seconds | Vague personas; "we'll know them when we see them" |
| 1.3 | **Value Proposition Development** | Product Marketing / CEO | Quantified value claims tied to customer outcomes; differentiated from top 3 competitors | Feature lists; "we're faster/better/cheaper" without proof |
| 1.4 | **Competitive Positioning** | Product Marketing | Clear positioning vs. alternatives (including status quo); battlecards that sales actually use | Reactive competitive responses; "we don't really have competitors" |
| 1.5 | **Pricing Strategy & Structure** | CEO / Finance / Product Marketing | Price architecture aligned to value delivered; defensible vs. competition; understood by sales | Cost-plus pricing; discounting >20% on most deals; price as primary objection |
| 1.6 | **Packaging & Bundling** | Product / Product Marketing | Packages that drive land-and-expand; clear upgrade paths; minimal custom SKUs | One-size-fits-all; proliferating custom deals |
| 1.7 | **Channel Strategy** | CEO / Sales Leadership | Channel economics that work; clear direct vs. partner rules of engagement | Channel conflict; margin confusion; partner underperformance |

---

## PHASE 2: COMMERCIAL ENABLEMENT
### 🟢 REMIDI TERRITORY

| Step | Activity | Owner | Success Signals | Failure Indicators |
|------|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| 2.1 | **Sales Methodology Selection** | Sales Leadership | Methodology matched to buyer journey complexity; trained and reinforced | MEDDIC on paper, Rolodex in practice |
| 2.2 | **Sales Enablement Content** | Product Marketing / Sales Enablement | Case studies, ROI tools, objection handlers reps actually use; content mapped to buyer journey stages | "Marketing gives us stuff we don't use"; reps build their own decks |
| 2.3 | **Buyer Journey Mapping** | Marketing / Sales | Documented stages with entry/exit criteria; content and touches mapped to each stage | Internal sales stages that don't match how buyers buy |
| 2.4 | **Qualification Framework** | Sales Leadership | Clear qualification criteria (BANT, MEDDPICC, etc.) enforced at stage gates | Everything is "qualified"; bloated pipeline |
| 2.5 | **Pricing Tools & CPQ** | RevOps / Sales Enablement | Reps can quote accurately without manager approval (within guardrails); deal desk for exceptions only | Every deal needs approval; spreadsheet quotes |
| 2.6 | **Competitive Intelligence System** | Product Marketing | Regular competitive updates; win/loss intelligence flows back; reps know how to position | Outdated battlecards; "I didn't know they could do that" |

---

## PHASE 3: DEMAND GENERATION
### 🟡 SHARED ZONE (Strategy-heavy front, execution-heavy back)

| Step | Activity | Owner | Success Signals | Failure Indicators |
|------|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| 3.1 | **Messaging Architecture** 🟢 | Product Marketing | Consistent messaging across channels; resonates in testing; sales can deliver it | Different story on website vs. sales deck vs. SDR script |
| 3.2 | **Channel Mix Strategy** 🟢 | Marketing Leadership | CAC by channel understood; mix optimized to target segments | "We do a little of everything"; can't attribute pipeline |
| 3.3 | **Campaign Execution** ⚪ | Demand Gen | Pipeline generated at target CAC; MQL-to-SQL conversion >25% | High volume, low quality; sales ignores marketing leads |
| 3.4 | **Lead Scoring & Routing** ⚪ | Marketing Ops / RevOps | Leads routed to right rep <4 hours; scoring predicts conversion | Leads rot; wrong rep gets wrong lead |
| 3.5 | **SDR/BDR Outbound** ⚪ | Sales Development | Meeting set rates >5%; quality conversations that convert | Spray and pray; high activity, low output |

---

## PHASE 4: SALES EXECUTION
### ⚪ ADJACENT (Well-tooled, not primary Remidi territory)

| Step | Activity | Owner | Success Signals | Failure Indicators |
|------|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| 4.1 | **Discovery** | AE | Needs uncovered; stakeholders mapped; compelling event identified | Demo jockeys; solution before problem understood |
| 4.2 | **Solution Development** | AE / SE | Solution mapped to stated needs; technical validation complete | Generic demos; "let me show you everything we do" |
| 4.3 | **Proposal & Negotiation** | AE | Proposal reflects value delivered; pricing holds; procurement navigated | Price caves immediately; scope creep in negotiation |
| 4.4 | **Close** | AE | Contract signed at target ACV; timeline met; clean handoff to CS | Slip, slip, slip; surprise discounts; "happy ears" forecasting |

**Pipeline Structure (Remidi diagnostic input):**
- Stage definitions and exit criteria
- Conversion rates by stage
- Velocity by stage
- Deal qualification rigor

---

## PHASE 5: CUSTOMER SUCCESS & EXPANSION
### ⚪ ADJACENT (Well-tooled, not primary Remidi territory)

| Step | Activity | Owner | Success Signals | Failure Indicators |
|------|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| 5.1 | **Onboarding** | CS / Implementation | Time-to-value <60 days; adoption milestones hit | Shelfware; "we'll get to it" |
| 5.2 | **Ongoing Success Management** | CSM | Health score green; regular value confirmation; executive relationships | Reactive firefighting; only talk when there's a problem |
| 5.3 | **Renewal Management** | CSM / Renewals Team | Renewal process starts 90+ days out; GRR >90% | Surprise churn; scramble renewals |
| 5.4 | **Expansion & Upsell** | CSM / AE | Expansion rate >110% NRR; natural progression through packages | Random upsell attempts; no expansion playbook |

---

## PHASE 6: FEEDBACK LOOPS
### 🔄 REMIDI TERRITORY (Most broken, highest opportunity)

| Step | Activity | Owner | Success Signals | Failure Indicators |
|------|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| 6.1 | **Win/Loss Analysis** | Product Marketing / Sales Leadership | Systematic capture; patterns identified; strategy adjusted quarterly | Anecdotal; "we lost on price" (always) |
| 6.2 | **Churn & Contraction Analysis** | CS Leadership / Product | Root causes quantified; preventable vs. acceptable churn identified | "They ran out of budget" without deeper diagnosis |
| 6.3 | **Price Realization Analysis** | Finance / RevOps | Discount patterns understood; price-to-value correlation tracked | No idea what we actually collect vs. list |
| 6.4 | **Competitive Intelligence Synthesis** | Product Marketing | Market moves tracked; positioning adjusted; product roadmap informed | Surprised by competitor moves |
| 6.5 | **Voice of Customer → Product** | Product | Customer needs translated to roadmap; feature adoption tracked | Product builds what they want, not what customers need |
| 6.6 | **Commercial Performance Review** | CEO / CRO | Monthly/quarterly review of commercial metrics; adjustments made | Annual planning only; no course correction |

## SUMMARY: WHERE REMIDI PLAYS

| Zone | Phases | Key Value |
|------|--------|-----------|
| **Primary Territory** | 1 (Strategy Foundation), 2 (Enablement), 6 (Feedback Loops) | No systematic tooling; high impact on downstream metrics; PE blind spot |
| **Diagnostic Input** | 3 (Demand Gen strategy), 4 (Pipeline structure) | Explain WHY execution metrics are what they are |
| **Out of Scope** | 3-5 (Execution) | Well-tooled; different buyers; scope creep risk |

## METRICS ALIGNMENT

| Metric | Primary Driver Phases | Remidi Relevance |
|--------|----------------------|------------------|
| **ARR** | All | Outcome metric - explains value of commercial health |
| **Win Rate** | 1, 2, 4 | Heavily influenced by Strategy + Enablement (Remidi zones) |
| **Sales Cycle** | 1, 2, 3, 4 | Buyer journey alignment, enablement quality |
| **CAC** | 1, 2, 3 | Segment selection, positioning efficiency, demand gen effectiveness |
| **GRR** | 1, 5, 6 | Value delivery vs. price; expectation setting; feedback loops |
| **NRR** | 1, 2, 5, 6 | Packaging/expansion paths; CS enablement; value realization |
| **LTV** | All | Outcome of getting everything right |
| **LTV:CAC** | All | Efficiency ratio - commercial health summary |

## OPEN QUESTIONS FOR DISCUSSION

1. **Feedback loop metrics**: Should we capture the *existence and quality* of feedback mechanisms (Win/Loss, Churn Analysis, etc.) as part of Commercial Health Score?

2. **Enablement effectiveness**: How do we measure whether enablement content is actually used vs. exists? Usage data? Sales survey?

3. **Services vs. SaaS differences**: 
   - Services: Utilization, margin by engagement type, SOW discipline
   - SaaS: More straightforward recurring metrics
   - Do we need a services-specific overlay?

4. **Pipeline structure diagnostic**: Confirm we want to assess *how* pipeline is structured (stages, definitions, rigor) without capturing *what's* in it (actual deals, amounts)

5. **Product-Market Fit feedback**: Where does "do we have the right product?" live? Currently implied in 6.5 but may need more explicit treatment.
